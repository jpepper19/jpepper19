## Bio
My name is Joshua Pepper, and I am a researcher interested in housing access and socioeconomic spatial equality. I graduated from Michigan State University with degrees in Geographic Information Science and Environmental Geography, and I am currently finishing my Master's degree in Geography from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. 

## Interests and Hobbies
I love playing soccer, running, and watching my favorite sports teams in my free time. Tech wise, I love being creative with geovisualizations, creating dynamic charts, and representing geographical data in interesting and innovative ways. In order to have more time to pursue my hobbies, I am very passionate about automating most functions in my life to make my day to day experiences easier. 

## Skills and Expertise
I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, ArcGIS API for Python, JavaScript, ArcGIS Pro, Excel, and Microsoft Office Products.
